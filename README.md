# Movie-Recommender-System
Content-Based Movie Recommendation System:
Developed a robust movie recommendation system using a content-based filtering approach, leveraging natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. The system analyzes various movie attributes, including genres, keywords, cast, and crew, to generate personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences.
Advanced Data Processing and Similarity Computation:
Implemented data processing pipelines to clean, preprocess, and transform movie metadata, employing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and feature extraction. Utilized the CountVectorizer for text vectorization and cosine similarity for calculating the similarity matrix, enabling accurate and efficient movie recommendations. The project also integrated external APIs to fetch movie posters and trailers, enhancing the user experience.
